Hybrid EEG Classification for Brain-Computer Interfaces
This repository demonstrates a hybrid training approach for EEG (Electroencephalography) classification in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. The approach pre-trains a neural network on synthetic EEG data and fine-tunes it with real-world EEG signals to achieve higher accuracy, faster convergence, and improved robustness.

1. Overview
Goal: Enhance EEG classification for real-time BCI applications using hybrid training.
Key Features:
Synthetic data generation (P300 vs. non-P300) for baseline learning.
Fine-tuning on MNE sample dataset for real-world adaptability.
Comprehensive PyTorch model with CELU, ReLU activations and dropout to prevent overfitting.
Evaluation metrics: accuracy, confusion matrix, precision/recall/F1.

3. Installation
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/my-bci-research.git
cd my-bci-research
Install Python dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure your Python version is 3.8+ (some libraries might not be compatible with older versions).
4. Usage
Step 1: Run the Main Script
bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
What Happens:
Generates synthetic EEG data simulating P300 vs. non-P300 signals.
Loads real EEG data from the MNE Sample Dataset, performs minimal preprocessing.
Pre-trains a neural network on synthetic data, then fine-tunes on real data if available.
Displays classification performance (accuracy, confusion matrix) in the console.
Step 2: (Optional) Visualize Results
bash
Copy
Edit
python plot_results.py
What Happens:
Plots a sample confusion matrix and training curves if you logged them in main.py.
Customize paths, arrays, or logs to match your training output.
5. Scripts
main.py
Purpose:
Generate synthetic data: Models P300 peaks, Gaussian noise, random spikes.
Load MNE dataset: Gains real EEG examples (MNE Sample Dataset).
Define PyTorch model: (CELU, ReLU activations, Softmax output).
Train model:
Pre-train on synthetic data.
Fine-tune on real data.
Evaluate: Prints accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report.
plot_results.py
Purpose:
Plots confusion matrix using matplotlib or seaborn.
Draws training curves (loss vs. epochs, accuracy vs. epochs).
Currently demonstrates placeholder arrays—modify to load actual training logs from main.py.
6. Data
Synthetic EEG Data
Automatically generated in main.py.
Simulates P300 waveforms around ~300 ms with configurable noise levels.
MNE Sample Dataset
Downloaded automatically by MNE-Python if not already present.
Contains EEG (and MEG) from an adult participant in an auditory-visual experiment.
Preprocessing includes band-pass filtering (1–40 Hz) and artifact rejection via EOG channels.
If you prefer a different dataset, modify load_mne_data() in main.py accordingly.

7. Results
Accuracy: Typically ~75–76% on real MNE data (depending on subset used).
Inference Time: ~3.97 ms per EEG sample (PyTorch CPU) for the final model.
Confusion Matrix: Showcases how many positive vs. negative samples are correctly identified.
Example (printed in console):
